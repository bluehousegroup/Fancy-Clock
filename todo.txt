1. Add reference to BHG - maybe an icon that animates and rotates the clock and displays our logo. or just a subtle version stuck to the bottom?
2. Add humans.txt - http://humanstxt.org/Standard.html
3. Add credit to inspiration - http://www.dougswordclock.com/
4. Reach out to Doug, he might appreciate it?
5. Adjust sizing so that it takes up more of the viewport, based on the device.
6. Git it?
7. Got it.
